This is the directory for the FierzFitter that I am trying to write.

All data/simulation files should be put in the directory called Data/ located at the base level of this repo.
The .gitignore will leave those alone.

comparehist.cc and comparehist.hh will run TFractionFitter once and create a ROOT histogram.
It will also print several values to screen and save the histogram in a pdf.

master_histfitter.cc will be very similar except it will run TFractionFitter and save the values to file.
This is designed to work in conjunction with a script that will execute this program over a series of iterations.

getvalues.C is a simple macro that will read in a TChain and print the histogram contents to a file.

genCoeff.cc will generate polynomial coefficients and print to a file.
This also does a ton of processing. The polynomial coefficients are originally thrown in Evis space
but then converted to Erecon space. Then they are plotted and the 2010 error envelope is plotted.
Some type of selection condition is checked and then the coefficients are saved.
